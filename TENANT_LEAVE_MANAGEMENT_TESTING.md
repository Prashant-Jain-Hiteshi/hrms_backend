  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Annual Leave",
    "numberOfLeaves": 20,
    "description": "Yearly vacation leave",
    "requiresApproval": true,
    "carryForward": true,
    "encashment": false,
    "eligibility": "all"
  }'
```

```bash
# Create Sick Leave Type
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/leave-types \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Sick Leave",
    "numberOfLeaves": 12,
    "description": "Medical leave for illness",
    "requiresApproval": false,

    "address": "456 Business Ave",
    "phone": "+9876543210",
    "email": "info@acme.com"
  }'

# Create admin for Acme Corp and login
# Then create leave types for Acme Corp
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/leave-types \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ACME_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{

    "numberOfLeaves": 15,
    "description": "Acme company annual leave"
  }'
```

### **6.2: Verify Cross-Tenant Isolation**

```bash
# Hiteshi Admin should NOT see Acme's leave types

  -H "Authorization: Bearer HITESHI_ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Acme Admin should NOT see Hiteshi's leave types
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/api/leave-types \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ACME_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

## **ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**
1. **Missing tenantId in JWT**: Re-login to get updated token
2. **Database Migration**: Ensure migration is applied
3. **Foreign Key Errors**: Check Company model associations
4. **Permission Errors**: Verify admin role and tenant context

### **Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Check JWT token payload
echo "YOUR_TOKEN" | base64 -d

# Verify database schema
psql -d your_db -c "\d leave_types"
```
